# GPS-Tracking-

Sole idea of this project was to make a cheap GPS tracking system with available equipments possible. Proposed GPS tracker was made for initially a Lab Project. We didnâ€™t want to spend money on buying GPS module which would cost around 100 USD in Bangladesh. The task was to make a clever GPS system using day to day available equipments. So we decided to make a simple GPS tracker possible. We wanted to use our smartphone which already has an imbedded GPS and use MATLAB code to build a system that exploits that module and provided update on the GPS location once initialized. 

"Detail Description" contains our process and components needed to make the system.
"GPS_Tracker.m" contains the MATLAB code need to be used to operate the system.
"location.kml" contains one of our altitude and longitude example that mobile app will be providing.
